# 👋 Hello World! I'm Nandani Yadav

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with a knack for turning coffee into code and bugs into features. My journey in tech is like a well-optimized algorithm: constantly improving and always aiming for the most efficient solution.

### 🧠 My Tech Stack is Taller Than My Coffee Stack

- 💻 Fluent in: Terraform, GO, AWS, Docker, Jenkins
- 🐍 Python whisperer (I speak parseltongue to my code)
- ☕ Java junkie (not just the beverage kind)
- 🌐 Web wizard with React, JavaScript, and Node.js
- 🗄️ Data wrangler: SQL, Hadoop, Apache Spark

## 🛠️ Current Adventures

- 🔍 Detecting infrastructure drift faster than you can say "AWS"
- 🤖 Teaching machines to learn (so I don't have to)
- 🚀 Transforming ETL systems from tortoise to hare

## 🏆 Achievements

- 🏎️ Turbo-charged SQL queries, making them 75% faster (My code runs so fast, it finishes before it starts)
- 🎨 Crafted a student dashboard that's more engaging than a cat video
- 🔐 Designed security systems to keep data safer than a squirrel's nut stash in winter

## 📫 Let's Connect!

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate, chat about tech, or debate the best programming puns. I'm always open to new opportunities and connections.
